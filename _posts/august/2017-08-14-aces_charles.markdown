i had a crisis last night and didn’t sleep. I spent the day down on myself, a bit sombre but trying to find small things to do that would make me happy, like lying down with my feet above my head.
i bought some coloured pencils from tesco this morning which were marketed as being bright but they were rather dull and I returned them for a refund. Never would I have thought that it would’ve been tesco to sell me a dissatisfactory product but you learn something new everyday (I learnt two)
